# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program is designed to track items that are sold in the store. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I had a lot of difficulties throughout this learning process, some I was able to make work others not so much. In this particular program, I was able to design the 
program that met the requirements.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I am thinking about making the code more readable to no coders as well and making the program more user-friendly by adding suggestions.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I didn't have much problem doing this project. I consulted help with Academic Support whenever I was stuck and they helped me whenever I was stuck.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Knowing how to loop is an essential skill and how to incorporate it into the code you are writing. This skill is what I am looking to take from this program.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
While I was writing code I tried to keep is as simple and readable by adding comments. The readability of the code is what I think makes it maintainable, readable, and
adaptable.
